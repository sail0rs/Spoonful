Spoonful: Your Pocket Recipe App

Spoonful is a simple  Android application that helps you discover delicious recipes.

Technologies Used:

This project leverages the following key technologies for efficient data handling and communication:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): We use JSON for seamless data interchange between the app and the backend, ensuring recipe details are structured and easy to parse.

Retrofit: This type-safe HTTP client simplifies the process of making network requests. Retrofit handles the heavy lifting of converting API responses into usable Java objects within the app.

HTTP Requests: The app communicates with a remote server using standard HTTP requests to fetch and display a wide variety of recipe information.

RESTful APIs: Spoonful interacts with the TheMealDB API (https://www.themealdb.com/) to access its extensive database of recipes, allowing for dynamic and up-to-date content.
